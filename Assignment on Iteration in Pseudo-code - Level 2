A three digit number is said to be an “Armstrong number” if the sum of the third power of its individual digits is equal to the number itself.
Example: 371 is an Armstrong number as 371 = 3 3 + 7 3 + 1 3
              407 is an Armstrong number as 407 = 4 3 + 0 3 + 7 3
Write a pseudo-code to check whether a given three digit number is an Armstrong number.

Pseudo-code
input Number
Sum = 0
Temp = Number
while(Number != 0) do
Remainder = Number % 10
Sum = Sum + Remainder * Remainder * Remainder
Number = Number / 10
end-while
if(Temp == Sum) then
display "This is an Armstrong Number"
else
display "This is not an Armstrong Number"
end-if
